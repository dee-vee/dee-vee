  <h1>Welcome! I am Depika Anchaliya </h1>
  <h3> Today I am showing off my html skillz</h3>
  <p> I am learning how to code for web developmemt. So far I have learned html, css and javascript in that order. The html part of the coding lets the browser know what information to display. This can range from words, to pictures and other media, to links and a lot more. The css portion of web development focuses on design aspects sunch as color, information placement and design. Javascript is very similar to python alothough there are some differences. Python is object orriented programming but java script is not. I'm still not sure about javascripts full function in web development but I think it will have to do with making it intereactive and taking inputs from users and returning stuff to users in a pretty way. I am really excited to do more with this. I have like 13 more lessons left on codeacdemy on web development and each lesson has a lot of stuff in it so it will take a while to complete it. As I learn more in each lesson I am adding elements to this fake website I have.  </p>
